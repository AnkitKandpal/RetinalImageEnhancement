# RetinalImageEnhancement
README
1. The code mentioned in the doc file is a MATLAB code. It has been developed in MATLAB 2019b.
2.  Code A: Image Enhancement Code receives the images from a directory, and then the function brisque() calculates the image quality before and after image enhancement.
3. Code B: It is the basic code for Edge based Texture Histogram Enhancement (ETHE). It is a function that receives the image from Code A and returns an enhanced image back.
